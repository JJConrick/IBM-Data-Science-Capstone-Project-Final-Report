IBM Data Science Capstone Project Final Report

In this project I predict if the SpaceX Falcon 9 first stage will land successfully. SpaceX advertises Falcon 9 rocket launches on its website, with a cost of 62 million dollars; other providers cost upward of 165 million dollars each, much of the savings are possible because SpaceX can reuse the first stage. 

By determining if the first stage will land, we can determine the cost of a launch. This information can be used if an alternate company wants to bid against SpaceX for a rocket launch.
