# IBM-Data-Science-Capstone-Project-Final-Report
IBM Data Science Capstone Project Final Report

This is the final project in the IBM Data Science Professional Certificate (https://www.coursera.org/professional-certificates/ibm-data-science), and reflects the completion of 10 in-depth courses in data science.

Key outcomes of completing the Data Science Professional Certificate include:

  - Mastering the most up-to-date practical skills and knowledge that data scientists use in their daily roles

  - Learning the tools, languages, and libraries used by professional data scientists, including Python and SQL

  - Mastering the skills required to import and clean data sets, analyze and visualize data, and build machine learning models and pipelines, and

  - Succesfully applying new skills to real-world projects and building a portfolio of data projects that showcase key data science proficiencies.

This includes learning in-demand skills used by professional data scientists including using databases, data visualization, statistical analysis, predictive modeling, machine learning algorithms, and data mining. It also involved working with the latest languages, tools,and libraries including Python, SQL, Jupyter notebooks, Github, Rstudio, Pandas, Numpy, ScikitLearn, Matplotlib, and more.


The Report

In this project I predict if the SpaceX Falcon 9 first stage will land successfully. SpaceX advertises Falcon 9 rocket launches on its website, with a cost of 62 million dollars; other providers cost upward of 165 million dollars each, much of the savings are possible because SpaceX can reuse the first stage. 

By determining if the first stage will land, we can determine the cost of a launch. This information can be used if an alternate company wants to bid against SpaceX for a rocket launch.

This project strategically positions a theoretical company as a competitive force in the dynamic space launch industry, leveraging machine learning for actionable insights. The report goes through key aspects of the methodology used in the project , including:​

Data Collection and Wrangling: Using Python, Jupyter notebooks, Pandas, NumPy, and BeautifulSoup for comprehensive data collection, cleaning, and feature engineering following API calls and web scraping, setting a robust foundation for subsequent analyses.​

EDA and Visualization: Employing SQL/SQLalchemy, visualizations, Folium, and Plotly Dash for exploring SpaceX's launch data trends and success factors.​

Predictive Analysis: Developing and validating machine learning models (logistic regression, SVM, Decision Tree, and KNN) using all mentioned libraries plus sklearn, including optimising hyperparameters using GridSearch. ​

Key findings and strategic insights include:​

Identifying SpaceX's consistent success improvement, highlighting KSC LC-39A as the most successful launch site. Discovering opportunities for targeted pricing strategies and increasing prediction precision.​

Equipping the company with actionable insights for cost estimation, competitive bidding, risk management, market differentiation, strategic planning, resource optimization, customer satisfaction, adaptability to market trends, and regulatory compliance, enhancing its competitive position in the industry.
